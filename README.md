## Snake Game using Turtle in Python
This Python program implements the classic Snake game using the Turtle module for graphics. It includes classes for managing the snake, scoreboard, and food objects.


## How to Play
Clone the repository or download the main.py file.

Run the main.py file using Python.

Use the arrow keys to control the snake.

Eat food (represented by a dot) to grow longer.

Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.

## Files
main.py: Main Python script containing the game logic.

snake.py: Python script containing the Snake class.

scoreboard.py: Python script containing the Scoreboard class.

food.py: Python script containing the Food class.


## Implementation Details
Snake Class (snake.py)

The Snake class manages the snake's movement, growth, and collision detection with walls and itself.

Scoreboard Class (scoreboard.py)

The Scoreboard class keeps track of the player's score and updates it as the snake eats food.

Food Class (food.py)

The Food class handles the creation of food objects at random locations on the screen.
